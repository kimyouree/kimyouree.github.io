    <h2>My Great Hobbies</h2>

    <!-- use an IMAGE RESIZER (many free options on Google or adobe?) don't resize using 'width' and 'height' attributes bc the whole image needs to be downloaded before resizing and it's SLOW (original images use a lot of mbs and space is used up quickly and eats your data); so it's way better to resize things before you put them on the web.
    
    How big should the image be? It depends. what is it exactly that you're trying to do with that picture. If you use placeKitten.com, that picture was 320 pixels wide by 240 pixels tall, so that sohuld give you a sense of how big things are in pixels; so that'll give you a sense of how big that is and whether your image should be a little biggr or a little smallerm than those dimensions, for whatever it is you're doing. -->
