				<h1>Alien Abduction Order Form</h1>
				<p>
					Fill out the form below to place an order for an alien
					abduction by one of our fine UFOs.

					<!-- this can go anywhere inside of the form tag -->
					<!-- `id` isn't required on a hidden field;
					so no label tag is required bc it doesn't need to be accessible. -->
					<input
						type="hidden"
						name="send_to"
						value="kimyouree@icloud.com"
					/>
					<!-- fieldset is good for accessibility; to break up your form into manageable chunks -->
					<fieldset>
						<!-- legend is designed to say what this fieldset is doing here -->
						<legend>Your contact information</legend>
						<!-- the for value should match the input's id argument -->
						<label for="name"> Your name </label>
						<!-- the javaScript processesing script (associated with forms)
								on the server needs this name field; sometimes those ids can
								also be used in JavaScript. But in our case, very specifically,
								the id is associated with the label.

								when we click our submit button for our form, and this
								whole contents of the form get sent to the server, right?
								The processing script on the server needs this `name` field
								in order to do whatever it needs to do. -->

						<!-- what do we still need to have when we have an input like this and
							the text right next to it? a LABEL tagðŸ“› around the whole thing.
							When the label wraps around the whole thing like this, you don't have to
							have that `for` - `id` thing going on explicitly.

							Whereas in the inputs/labels where we have the actual label separated
							from the actual widget (input); like in the Contact Information section,
							you need that connection of `id` and `for`, but down here in the Email List
							and radio button sections, where we've got our options together as a unit,
							you can just use the plain old label tag (with no id attribute), like here.
						-->
						<label>
							<!-- pre-select the checkbox -->
							<input
								type="checkbox"
								name="subscribe"
								value="subscribe"
								checked
							/>
							Add me to your email list!
						</label>
					</fieldset>

					<!--
						no `id`: bc there's no label
						no `name`: bc the btn has nothing to do with any values that we're
							trying to process on the server; this is just sending the information over.
						therefore there's also no `value` for the btn

<!--
	rundown on the difference between id, name and value:

	the value of `id` (in the input) and the value of the `for` attribute in the label tag
	they have to be the same, always. ids and for, go together

	`name` is for backend processing.
	`value` is the one that's going to vary. But `value` is the actual value.

	Instructor likens `name and value` to a css property "border: 1px solid red" bc the
	The property is `name` and the `value` is whatever it is.

	ie. the phone input's `name` is the property name (of the box) and the `value` is whatever
		the user entered as input to that field. A key-value-pair; or a header-column relationhip
		in excel.

	In the case of a RADIO BTN for example, or for a SELECT BOX, there's nothing to type in, right?
	So somehow we still need to transmit a value. And so that's why we have a `value` property here
	for radio buttons and select boxes (also for checkboxes).
